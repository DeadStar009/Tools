# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Tool Generator is a system designed to automatically create production-ready tools based on external API specifications. The system ingests OpenAPI specifications from various providers (like Shopify, Monday, Square), processes user queries, identifies relevant API endpoints, and generates clean, production-ready code for tools that interact with these APIs. The system includes mechanisms for chunking and storing large API specifications, generating code based on user queries, validating the generated tools through automated testing, and storing the resulting tools in a database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Specification Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to efficiently process and store large OpenAPI specifications, so that relevant API endpoints can be quickly identified for tool creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OpenAPI specification is provided THEN the system SHALL process and store it in a structured format.
2. WHEN an OpenAPI specification is too large for direct processing THEN the system SHALL chunk it into manageable pieces.
3. WHEN storing chunked OpenAPI specifications THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between chunks to preserve context.
4. WHEN a new version of an API specification is provided THEN the system SHALL update the stored specification without disrupting existing tools.
5. WHEN processing OpenAPI specifications THEN the system SHALL extract and index key information including endpoints, parameters, authentication requirements, and response formats.
6. WHEN storing API specifications THEN the system SHALL use CosmosDB as the storage solution.

### Requirement 2: Query-Based Tool Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide a query describing my needs so that the system can generate a relevant API tool without requiring me to understand the API's technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL identify relevant API endpoints from the stored specifications.
2. WHEN identifying relevant endpoints THEN the system SHALL consider the query context, API capabilities, and constraints.
3. WHEN multiple relevant endpoints are identified THEN the system SHALL determine the optimal combination of endpoints to fulfill the query.
4. WHEN generating a tool THEN the system SHALL create clean, production-ready code without unnecessary comments.
5. WHEN generating a tool THEN the system SHALL handle authentication requirements specified in the API documentation.
6. WHEN a query cannot be fulfilled by available API endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the limitations and prompt the user about it.

### Requirement 3: Tool Validation and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want generated tools to be automatically validated and tested, so that I can be confident they will work correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is generated THEN the system SHALL create test cases to validate its functionality.
2. WHEN test cases fail THEN the system SHALL analyze the errors and regenerate the tool with corrections.
3. WHEN validating a tool THEN the system SHALL test against actual API responses or realistic mocks.
4. WHEN a tool passes validation THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the tests performed and their results.
5. WHEN a tool is regenerated after test failures THEN the system SHALL ensure that previous errors are addressed.
6. WHEN validating a tool THEN the system SHALL verify that it handles API errors and edge cases appropriately.

### Requirement 4: Tool Storage and Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want generated tools to be stored and managed efficiently, so that they can be retrieved, updated, or removed as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is successfully validated THEN the system SHALL store it in the tools database.
2. WHEN storing a tool THEN the system SHALL include metadata about its purpose, the API it interacts with, and its capabilities.
3. WHEN a tool is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from the database if it exists.
4. WHEN an API specification is updated THEN the system SHALL flag affected tools for review.
5. WHEN a tool is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to remove it from the database.
6. WHEN storing tools THEN the system SHALL use CosmosDB as the storage solution.

### Requirement 5: Caching System

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to cache frequently used data and results, so that tool generation and execution are as efficient as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing similar queries THEN the system SHALL use cached results to improve response time.
2. WHEN an API specification is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant cache entries.
3. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate expiration policies.
4. WHEN a cache miss occurs THEN the system SHALL fall back to the primary data source seamlessly.
5. WHEN storing cached data THEN the system SHALL use CosmosDB as the storage solution.
6. WHEN the cache reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL implement an appropriate eviction policy.

### Requirement 6: Master LLM Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a master LLM component to orchestrate the tool generation process, so that the system can intelligently handle complex queries and adapt to different API specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is received THEN the master LLM SHALL analyze it to understand the user's intent.
2. WHEN relevant API documentation is identified THEN the master LLM SHALL extract constraints and capabilities.
3. WHEN creating prompts for the code generator THEN the master LLM SHALL include all necessary context from the API documentation.
4. WHEN receiving error feedback from validation THEN the master LLM SHALL analyze the errors and adjust its approach.
5. WHEN generating tools THEN the master LLM SHALL ensure they adhere to best practices for the specific API.
6. WHEN handling different API specification formats THEN the master LLM SHALL adapt its processing approach accordingly.

### Requirement 7: System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool generation system to integrate with existing infrastructure, so that it can be easily incorporated into our workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing databases THEN the system SHALL use standardized interfaces that can work with CosmosDB.
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate APIs for integration with other systems.
3. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL support standard authentication methods.
4. WHEN logging system activities THEN the system SHALL use a standardized logging format.
5. WHEN scaling the system THEN it SHALL be able to handle increased load without significant performance degradation.
