# Design Document: API Tool Generator

## Overview

The API Tool Generator is a system designed to automatically create production-ready tools based on external API specifications. It processes OpenAPI specifications, handles user queries, identifies relevant API endpoints, generates code, validates the generated tools, and stores them for future use. The system employs a combination of large language models (LLMs), vector databases, and traditional databases to achieve its goals.

This design document outlines the architecture, components, data models, and other aspects of the system to guide its implementation.

## Architecture

The API Tool Generator follows a microservices architecture with the following high-level components:

## Error Handling

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **Validation Errors**: Errors related to invalid inputs or API constraints.
   - Handled by providing clear feedback to users and suggesting corrections.

2. **Processing Errors**: Errors that occur during the processing of API specifications.
   - Logged for analysis and reported to administrators.
   - Partial results may be used if available.

3. **Generation Errors**: Errors that occur during tool generation.
   - Analyzed by the Master LLM to adjust the generation approach.
   - May trigger regeneration with modified parameters.

4. **Validation Failures**: Errors that occur during tool validation.
   - Detailed error information is provided to the Tool Generator for correction.
   - Users are notified of validation issues with explanations.

5. **System Errors**: Infrastructure or dependency failures.
   - Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms.
   - Provide appropriate error responses with retry information.

Error responses follow a consistent format:

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  details?: any;
  timestamp: string;
  requestId: string;
  suggestions?: string[];
}
```

## Testing Strategy

## Additional Considerations

### Chunking Strategy for OpenAPI Specifications

The system will implement a structured approach to parsing and chunking OpenAPI specifications, addressing their potentially unstructured nature:

1. **JSON/YAML Parsing and Normalization**:
   - Use OpenAPI parser libraries (like Swagger Parser) to validate and normalize specifications.
   - Convert all specifications to a consistent internal representation regardless of original format.
   - Handle different OpenAPI versions (2.0, 3.0, 3.1) through version-specific adapters.

2. **Structure-Aware Chunking**:
   - Parse the OpenAPI specification as a structured document rather than plain text.
   - Maintain the hierarchical relationships between elements (paths, operations, schemas).
   - Create chunks based on the specification's natural boundaries:
     - Group by resource/endpoint paths
     - Group by tags defined in the specification
     - Group related schemas and their references
     - Preserve parent-child relationships between operations and their parameters/responses

3. **Reference Resolution**:
   - Resolve all `$ref` references before chunking to ensure complete context.
   - Track cross-references between chunks to maintain relationships.
   - Include necessary context when a chunk references elements in another chunk.

4. **Metadata Extraction**:
   - Extract structured metadata from each chunk (paths, operations, parameters, etc.).
   - Create a searchable index of this metadata for quick retrieval.
   - Use this metadata to filter and prioritize chunks during retrieval.

5. **Vector Embeddings**:
   - Generate embeddings for each chunk to enable semantic search.
   - Create separate embeddings for different aspects (descriptions, examples, parameter names).
   - Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient similarity search.
   - Update embeddings when specifications change.

6. **Hybrid Retrieval System**:
   - Combine structured metadata search with vector similarity search.
   - Use metadata to filter candidate chunks and vector search for ranking.
   - Implement a scoring system that considers both structural relevance and semantic similarity.

### Caching Strategy

The system implements a comprehensive multi-level caching strategy using CosmosDB with specific optimizations:

1. **Query Result Caching**:
   - Cache results for similar queries using semantic similarity matching.
   - Implement TTL-based expiration with configurable timeframes based on query complexity.
   - Invalidate cache when API specifications change using a versioning system.
   - Store query fingerprints to quickly identify similar queries.

2. **API Context Caching**:
   - Cache frequently accessed API endpoints and their details in a dedicated CosmosDB container.
   - Implement a distributed LRU eviction policy with CosmosDB's TTL feature.
   - Preload cache with popular endpoints based on usage analytics.
   - Use CosmosDB's change feed to propagate cache updates across services.

3. **Tool Generation Caching**:
   - Cache intermediate results during tool generation in a separate CosmosDB container.
   - Implement a component-based caching system to reuse code fragments across similar tools.
   - Use versioning to handle API changes with automatic invalidation.
   - Store generated code templates with parameterization for quick customization.

4. **Distributed Cache Implementation**:
   - Use CosmosDB's multi-region capabilities for globally distributed caching.
   - Implement local in-memory caches (using Redis) for ultra-high-frequency access patterns.
   - Create a cache hierarchy with tiered expiration policies.
   - Implement cache warming strategies for predictable workloads.

5. **Cache Consistency Management**:
   - Use optimistic concurrency control for cache updates.
   - Implement a pub/sub mechanism for cache invalidation events.
   - Track dependencies between cached items for cascading invalidation.
   - Use write-through caching for critical data paths.

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Secure API access with appropriate authentication mechanisms.
   - Implement role-based access control for administrative functions.
   - Protect sensitive API credentials.

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
   - Implement proper key management.
   - Follow data protection regulations.

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs.
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

4. **Dependency Security**:
   - Regularly update dependencies.
   - Scan for vulnerabilities.
   - Follow security best practices for third-party libraries.

### Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Design stateless services that can scale horizontally.
   - Use container orchestration for dynamic scaling.
   - Implement load balancing across service instances.

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - Use CosmosDB's partitioning capabilities.
   - Implement efficient query patterns.
   - Consider read replicas for high-read scenarios.

3. **Processing Optimization**:
   - Parallelize processing where possible.
   - Implement batch processing for large specifications.
   - Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks.

4. **Resource Management**:
   - Monitor resource usage.
   - Implement auto-scaling based on load.
   - Optimize resource allocation.### LLM
